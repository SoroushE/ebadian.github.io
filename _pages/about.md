I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the
[Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/)
at the **University of Toronto**,
where I am fortunate to be working under the supervision of
[Nisarg Shah](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/).
Before joining UofT, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from
[Sharif University of Technology](http://ce.sharif.edu/), and
I spent four years in the tech industry as a software engineer and
technical manager, building platforms with millions of users.



My research lies at the intersection of algorithms,
artificial intelligence, and economics,
and focuses on design fair and efficient mechanisms
to aggregate diverse preferences into collective decisions
with applications ranging from voting and
democratic systems (citizen's assemblies)
to resource allocation and AI alignment.
