I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the
[Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/)
at the **University of Toronto**,
where I am fortunate to be working under the supervision of
[Nisarg Shah](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/).
Before joining UofT, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from
[Sharif University of Technology](http://ce.sharif.edu/).

My research is focused on **fair division** and
**computational social choice**, though more broadly,
I am interested in theoretical computer science (especially algorithms)
and its intersection with economics.
